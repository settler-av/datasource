PO_HEADERS_ALL,"PO_HEADERS_ALL contains header information for your purchasing documents. You need one row for each document you create. There are six types of documents that use PO_HEADERS_ALL: RFQs, Quotations, Standard purchase orders, Planned purchase orders, Blanket purchase orders and Contracts. Each row contains buyer information, supplier information, brief notes, foreign currency information, terms and conditions information, and the status of the document. Oracle Purchasing uses this information to record information that is related to a complete document. PO_HEADER_ID is the unique system-generated primary key and is invisible to the user. SEGMENT1 is the system-assigned number you use to identify the document in forms and reports. Oracle Purchasing generates SEGMENT1 using the PO_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER_CONT_ALL table if you choose to let Oracle Purchasing generate document numbers for you. SEGMENT1 is not unique for the entire table. Different document types can share the same numbers. You can uniquely identify a row in PO_HEADERS_ALL using PRC_BU_ID, SEGMENT1, and TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE, or using PO_HEADER_ID. If APPROVED_FLAG is 'Y', the purchase order is approved. If your document type is a blanket purchase order, contract purchase order, RFQ, or quotation, Oracle Purchasing uses START_DATE and END_DATE to store the valid date range for the document. Oracle Purchasing only uses BLANKET_TOTAL_AMOUNT for blanket purchase orders or contract purchase orders. If you autocreate a quotation from an RFQ using the Copy Document window, Oracle Purchasing stores the foreign key to your original RFQ in FROM_HEADER_ID. Oracle Purchasing also uses FROM_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE to indicate that you copied the quotation from an RFQ. Oracle Purchasing does not use SUMMARY_FLAG and ENABLED_FLAG. Because future versions of Oracle Purchasing will use them, SUMMARY_FLAG and ENABLED_FLAG should always be 'N' and 'Y' respectively. You enter document header information in the Header region of the Purchase Orders, RFQs, and Quotations windows.

PO_LINES_ALL,"PO_LINES_ALL stores current information about each purchase order line. You need one row for each line you attach to a document. There are five document types that use lines: RFQs, Quotations, Standard purchase orders, Blanket purchase orders and Planned purchase orders. Each row includes the line number, item number, category, unit, price, tax information, matching information, and quantity ordered for the line. Oracle Purchasing uses this information to record and update item and price information for purchase orders, quotations, and RFQs. PO_LINE_ID is the unique system-generated line number invisible to the user. LINE_NUM is the number of the line on the purchase order. Oracle Purchasing uses CONTRACT_ID to reference a contract purchase order from a standard purchase order line.  Oracle Purchasing uses ALLOW_PRICE_OVERRIDE_FLAG, COMMITTED_AMOUNT, QUANTITY_COMMITTED, MIN_RELEASE_AMOUNT only for blanket and planned purchase order lines. The QUANTITY field stores the total quantity of all purchase order shipment lines (found in PO_LINE_LOCATIONS_ALL).

PO_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL,"PO_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL contains accounting distribution information for a purchase order shipment line. You need one row for each distribution line you attach to a purchase order shipment. There are four types of documents using distributions in Oracle Purchasing: Standard Purchase Orders, Planned Purchase Orders, Planned Purchase Order Releases and Blanket Purchase Order Releases. Each row includes the destination type, requestor ID, quantity ordered and deliver-to location for the distribution. Oracle Purchasing uses this information to record accounting and requisition information for purchase orders and releases. PO_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL is one of five tables storing purchase order and release information. Some columns in PO_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL contain information only if certain conditions exist: If you autocreate this accounting distribution from a requisition, REQ_DISTRIBUTION_ID corresponds to the ID of the requisition distribution you copy on the purchase order. If you use a foreign currency on your purchase order, Oracle Purchasing stores currency conversion information in RATE and RATE_DATE. If you use encumbrance, GL_ENCUMBERED_DATE and GL_ENCUMBERED_PERIOD_NAME contain encumbrance information Oracle Purchasing uses to create journal entries in Oracle General Ledger. If you do not autocreate the purchase order from online requisitions, REQ_LINE_REFERENCE_NUM and REQ_HEADER_REFERENCE_NUM contain the requisition number and requisition line number of the corresponding paper requisition. These two columns are not foreign keys to another table. If the distribution corresponds to a blanket purchase order release, PO_RELEASE_ID identifies this release. If SOURCE_DISTRIBUTION_ID has a value, the distribution is part of a planned purchase order release. If you cancel the distribution, Oracle Purchasing automatically updates QUANTITY_CANCELLED or GL_CANCELLED_DATE. Oracle Purchasing also enters UNENCUMBERED_AMOUNT if you use encumbrance. You enter distribution information in the Distributions window, accessible through the  Purchase Orders and Releases windows.

AP_INVOICES_ALL,"AP_INVOICES_ALL contains records for invoices you enter.  There is one row for each invoice youenter.  An invoice can have one or more invoice distribution lines.  An invoice can also have one or more scheduled payments.   
An invoice of type EXPENSE REPORT must relate to a row in AP_EXPENSE_REPORT_HEADERS_ALL unless the record has been purged from AP_EXPENSE_REPORT_HEADERS_ALL.  Your Oracle Payables application uses the INTEREST type invoice for interest that it calculates on invoices that are overdue.  
Your Oracle Payables application links the interest invoice to the original invoice by inserting the INVOICE_ID  in the AP_INVOICE_RELATIONSHIPS table. This table corresponds to the Invoices window.

AP_INVOICE_LINES_ALL,"AP_INVOICE_LINES_ALL contains records for invoice lines entered manually, generated automatically or imported from the Open Interface.
An invoice can have one or more invoice lines.  An invoice line can have one or more invoice distributions.   An invoice line represents goods (direct or indirect materials), service(s), and/or associated tax/freight/miscellaneous charges invoiced from a supplier.  An invoice line should contain all the attributes that are present on the physical or electronic invoice presented by the supplier.  These attributes should suffice in specifying the charge/expense/asset information that makes up the invoice line. An invoice line can be of any of the following types: Item, Freight, Miscellaneous, Tax, Prepayment or Withholding Tax.  Prepayment Lines are generated via prepayment application.
Item type lines may represent a match to a purchase order or receipt, a price correction against an existing purchase order or receipt matched invoice line, a quantity correction against an existing purchase order or receipt matched invoice line,
an invoice correction against an existing non-matched invoice line or a non-matched invoice line.
Freight and Miscellaneous lines may represent a match to a Receipt or may be non-matched.
Freight and Miscellaneous type lines may be allocated to Item type lines whenever they are not themselves matched to a receipt.
Rules for allocation may be entered in the Allocations module. Allocations are stamped on the distributions for such a Freight or Miscellaneous type line.
Lines may be generated automatically via any of the following methods:
.	Match to purchase order or receipt requested from the invoice header
.	Generation of freight automatically from the invoice header
.	Generation of Item line from Distribution Set requested from the invoice header
.	Generation of Freight/Miscellaneous from purchase order or receipt matching windows
.	Prepayment application
Lines will also be created during import of Open Interface invoices.
It is the distributions for a line, and not the line itself, that will carry the status relative to Validation, Encumbrance, and Accounting.
Furthermore, it is the Distributions for a line that get transferred to Oracle Assets and/or processed by Oracle Projects. However, lines will contain an Approval status.
A line may be discarded on its own or as part of cancellation of the invoice.  A discarded line will have an amount of 0 and will be marked as discarded.
During discarding of a line, appropriate distributions are generated to reverse the effect of any existing distributions for the line

AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL,"AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL holds the distribution information that is  manually entered or system-generated.  There is one row for each invoice distribution.  A distribution must be associated with an invoice.  An invoice  can have multiple distributions. Examples of when your Oracle Payables application automatically creates rows  in this table include the following:
You choose a distribution set at the invoice header level.
You match an invoice line to a purchase order or receipt. The system uses information from the matched purchase order or receipt to create the distributions.
You match a credit or debit memo to an invoice.
You generate charge distributions (tax, freight, misc.) from allocation rules.
You apply a prepayment or unapply a prepayment.
Payables automatically withholds tax.
Payables creates an interest invoice.
When you account for an invoice, the Payables Accounting Process creates  accounting events, accounting entry headers and accounting entry lines for  those distributions that have accounting dates included in the selected  accounting date range. The Transfer to General Ledger process can then  transfer the accounting entries to General Ledger as journal entries.  Values
for POSTED_FLAG are Y for accounted distributions or N for unaccounted  distributions. Invoice distributions can be interfaced over/from Oracle Assets or Oracle  Projects.  Your Oracle Payables application sets the ASSETS_ADDITION_FLAG to U  for distributions not tested by Oracle Assets; Oracle Assets then adjusts this  flag after it tests a distribution for assignment as an asset.  To avoid the  same invoice distribution being interfaced to Oracle Project and Oracle  Assets, you must interface any project-related invoice distribution to Oracle   projects before you can interface it to Oracle Assets.  If a project-related  invoice distribution is charged to a capital project in Oracle Projects,  Oracle Projects sets the ASSETS_ADDITION_FLAG to P when the PA_ADDITION_FLAG  is set to Y, Z, or T.  Oracle Assets only picks up invoice distributions with  the ASSET_ADDITION_FLAG set to U, and if project-related, with the  PA_ADDITION_FLAG set to Y, Z, or T.  PA_ADDITION_FLAG tracks the status of  project-related supplier invoice distributions and expense report
distributions.  For supplier invoice distributions entered via Oracle  Payables, the PA_ADDITION_FLAG is set to N if the distribution is  project-related, otherwise it is set to E, and it is updated by Oracle  Projects when the distribution is processed by the Oracle Projects Interface  Supplier Invoice process.  Oracle Projects sets the PA_ADDITION_FLAG to Y or Z  after the item is successfully processed, or may be set to a rejection code if  the line is rejected during transfer to Oracle Projects.  See Payables Lookup  Listing for all the errors.  You must correct the rejection reason and try to  retransfer the line.  For supplier invoice adjustment distributions interfaced  from Oracle Projects to Oracle Payables (which must net to zero with another  distribution), the value for the PA_ADDITION_FLAG is set to T.
This table corresponds to the Distributions window.
